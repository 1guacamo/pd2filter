# Wolfie's Project Diablo 2 Loot Filters

# [Detailed](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/blob/main/detailed.filter)
A version of the filter that has lines for every single item in the game. This is for ease-of-use and very quick editing as you should ideally only ever have to comment or uncomment a line. This version will show and notify a lot of items by default with the idea that you can slowly start to comment out things you don't need. The flip side is that since this filter contains lines for every item you can easily just uncomment a line for things you want to show that aren't currently showing.

# Compact
N/A yet. This version will contain only the lines that are already uncommented in the Detailed version. This version will still show and notify a lot of items that you can slowly start to comment out but you have to have knowledge of filters to add your own items as they are not already all in there for you to just uncomment easily.

# Wolfie
N/A yet. This version is basically a copy of my own personal filter. Will most likely contain things you don't think are worth it and not contain things you think are worth it. No support will be given for this version.


For all versions of the filter I take no responsibility for any items that are accidentally hidden and/or do not notify. I do try my best to test these filters and ensure they are working properly but there's always room for error.
